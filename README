# Setting up cogphp.
======================
1.	Extract the downloaded package and (re)name the folder to simply 'cogphp'.
2.	Place the 'cogphp' folder in your site root folder.
3.	Include the cogphp load script at the top of your page as follows:
	<?php require_once '{site-root}/cogphp/load.php'; ?>
	After including the load script, the following variables are available:
	-> $_root The site root.
	-> $_home The site 'home' directory, supposedly the directory above the site root (May be useful in some host setups).
	-> $_base The base url for use in src and href attributes that require a url value.
4.	[Optional] Call Cog::test() to print a sample output to show that cogphp is working.
